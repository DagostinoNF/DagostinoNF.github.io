# My Portfolio
Welcome to Nicole D'Agostino's programming portfolio. I am a language analyst currently learning about NLP techniques. These are some of the projects I've been working on.


# [Project 1: Drug Review Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/DagostinoNF/Drug-Review-Sentiment-Analysis)
• The objective of this project is to analyze the sentiments expressed in the reviews of a given drug.

• I based the project around the reviews of Levonorgestrel, a birth control drug.

•	I apply the basics of NLTK text analysis to the drug reviews.

•	I use Sentiment Intensity Analyzer to categorize the reviews.

•	I apply Gensim Doc2Vec to generate representation vectors.


# [Project 2: Movie Ratings Classifier](https://github.com/DagostinoNF/Movie_Reviews_Project)
• The objective of this project is to develop a classifier that can categorize text into positive and negative reviews.

•	I compare the metrics of four classifiers: Linear SVC, Random Forest, Ada Boost and Multilayered Perceptron

•	I apply a voting classifier to best utilize all the classifier's strenghts

•	I test the model with new reviews.
