# My Portfolio
Welcome to Nicole D'Agostino's programming portfolio. These are some of the projects I've been working on.

# [Project 1: Drug Review Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/DagostinoNF/Drug-Review-Sentiment-Analysis)
• I based the project around the reviews of Levonorgestrel, a birth control drug.

•	I apply the basics of NLTK text analysis to the drug reviews.

•	I use Sentiment Intensity Analyzer to categorize the reviews.

•	I apply Gensim Doc2Vec to generate representation vectors.
